# XploreApp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.2.9.

## Description

This is a quick Angular project built to learn the ins and outs of the design of Angular as well as how the CLI works. This also uses RxJS to handle reactive data streams and ngrx to handle app level state to prevent excessive fetch requests. Data for the app comes from JSON placeholder.

The app is a messageboard. User auth won't be implemented in MVP, but may do for the future if the project grows. Anyone on the page can leave a post and then can leave comments on the post. Posts and comments have full CRUD.

## Running the app

### Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.


## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
